Welcome to simple and elegant Study Buddy Timer â€“ your study companion I created to help me focus! 

## How to Use

1. **Open the Timer**: Double-click `index.html` to open the timer in your web browser.

2. **Start Studying**: Click "Start" for a default 25-minute study session.

3. **Take Breaks**: Hit "Pause" for breaks or pause the timer.

4. **Reset When Needed**: Click "Reset" to start a new session or adjust the timer.

## How it Works

Study Pal Timer uses simple JavaScript to countdown. Get an alert when it's time to go for a walk.
I'm learning Javascript so the Study Pal will improve with time.
